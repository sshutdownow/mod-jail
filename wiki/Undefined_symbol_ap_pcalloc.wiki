= Introduction =

Official port of *mod_jail* version 0.4 have had a bug.

= Details =

So, if you install mod_jail from ports for apache2 or apache22 and start *Apache*, you will see something like this:
{{{
httpd: Syntax error on line 114 of /usr/local/etc/apache22/httpd.conf: Cannot load /usr/local/libexec/apache22/mod_jail.so into server: 
/usr/local/libexec/apache22/mod_jail.so: Undefined symbol "ap_pcalloc"
}}}

[http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports-bugs/2009-February/157933.html Error has appeared when support for the new jail API version two was added.]

To *fix* that you should change ap_pcalloc to apr_pcalloc and rebuild module:
  * cd /usr/ports/www/mod_jail
  * make config
  * perl -pi -e 's/ap_pcalloc/apr_pcalloc/g' work/mod_jail/mod_jail.c
  * make deinstall ; make all install
