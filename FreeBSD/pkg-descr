mod_jail2 is Apache 2.0.xx module, that makes running Apache in a secure jail
prison easy (without creating a real jail environment containing a copy of
/lib, /libexec, /usr/lib, etc), so it is intended to run on FreeBSD only. It is
similar to mod_chroot, but uses FreeBSD's specific system call - jail. Also
mod_jail make it possible to change securelevel into jail prison.
